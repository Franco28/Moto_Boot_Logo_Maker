Version 2.2 - Released Sept 15, 2014

- [new] Metadata added to created logo.bin files - The following data is present.
- Version of this program that created the bin file. (was present since Version 2.0)

---------------------------------------
Version 2.1 - Released Sept 9, 2014

- [new] Default logo_charge image predefined, where applicable.
- [new] logo_boot and logo_unlocked are now linked together, unless you load different images for each of them.

---------------------------------------
Version 2.0 - Released Sept 8, 2014
---------------------------------------
- [new] Last selected device is now remembered between sessions.

- [new] Added in Moto X 2nd Gen. (Larger screen in Moto X 2nd Gen, logo_charge and logo_lowpower present. The one thing that bugs me, is that motorola did not expand the logo partition size, still retains it at 4MiB for that device, so one is pretty limited in full screen picture complexity.)
- [fixed] Fixed a few bugs that were introduced in Version 1.9

---------------------------------------
Version 1.9 - Released Sept 3, 2014
---------------------------------------
- [new] Added in the stock images for logo_battery, logo_lowpower, and logo_unplug, that the program will put into the logo.bin, if you don't specify a custom logo for these images.

---------------------------------------

- [changed] An opportunity to abort the process is presented if you try to save bin/zip with no images loaded.
- [new] Tool tips now added on the tree nodes for logo_boot, logo_battery, and logo_unlocked. As I do not have a Moto E, I cannot determine what causes logo_lowpower and logo_unplug to show, to be able to advise on these.
- [new] logo.bin and flashable zips can be dragged and dropped onto the application.
